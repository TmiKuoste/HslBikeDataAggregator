# HslBikeDataAggregator — Copilot Instructions

## System Overview

Helsinki city bike data backend. Part of a two-repo system:

| Repo | Role | Tech | Hosting |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HslBikeApp** | Blazor WASM frontend | .NET 10, Blazor WebAssembly, Leaflet.js | GitHub Pages |
| **HslBikeDataAggregator** (this repo) | C# backend service | .NET 10, Azure Functions (isolated worker) | Azure Functions (Consumption) |

## Architecture

This service is the **only component** that holds the HSL Digitransit API key.
The Blazor frontend calls this service's REST API — it never calls HSL directly.

### Functions

| Function | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PollStations` | Timer (every 2-5 min) | Fetch live bike data from Digitransit, store snapshot |
| `GetStations` | HTTP GET | Return latest station availability |
| `GetStationAvailability` | HTTP GET | Return aggregated hourly availability profile for a station |
| `GetStationDestinations` | HTTP GET | Return popular destinations from HSL open history data |
| `GetSnapshots` | HTTP GET | Return recent snapshots for trend calculation |

### Storage

- Azure Blob Storage for aggregated data (snapshots, hourly profiles, destination data).
- Data format: JSON blobs, one per station for availability profiles.

## API Contract

- `GET /api/stations` — current bike availability for all stations
- `GET /api/stations/{id}/availability` — aggregated hourly availability (24 buckets)
- `GET /api/stations/{id}/destinations` — top destinations by trip count
- `GET /api/snapshots` — last N snapshots for trend arrows

All endpoints return JSON. CORS enabled for `https://kuoste.github.io`.

## Secrets

- `DigitransitSubscriptionKey` — stored in Azure Functions app settings, NEVER exposed to frontend.
- `AzureWebJobsStorage` — connection string for blob storage.

## Key Models (compatible with HslBikeApp)

- `BikeStation` — id, name, lat/lon, capacity, bikesAvailable, spacesAvailable, isActive
- `StationSnapshot` — timestamp + dictionary of stationId -> bikeCount
- `StationHistory` — departure/arrival station pair, tripCount, avg duration/distance
- `HourlyAvailability` — hour (0-23) + average bike count for a station

## Conventions

- Azure Functions isolated worker model (.NET 10).
- Records for data models, classes for services.
- File-scoped namespaces, nullable enabled, implicit usings.
- Return empty collections on failure, never null.
- Use `ReadFromJsonAsync<T>()` / `System.Text.Json` for serialization.

## Delivery Workflow

- Keep implementation work tied to an open GitHub issue.
- Use an issue branch named `issue-<number>-<short-description>` for delivery.
- If an issue was closed before its code was pushed, reopen the issue before continuing work.
- Add or update automated tests for each delivered behavior or repository-level configuration change.
- Run `dotnet build HslBikeDataAggregator.slnx` and the relevant tests before considering the issue complete.
- Do not treat an issue as done until the code is committed on the issue branch and ready to merge.
